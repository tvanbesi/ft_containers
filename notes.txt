logaritmicly growing vector check how the real one behaves (probably keeps a copy of original
size (min 1 I guess)), same question for reserve

assign:range iterator category

Additionally, in the range version (1), if InputIterator is not at least of a forward iterator
category (i.e., it is just an input iterator) the new capacity cannot be determined beforehand
and the operation incurs in additional logarithmic complexity in the new size (reallocations
while growing).


Does resize also grow logaritmicly ?
