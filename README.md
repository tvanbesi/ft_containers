# ft_containers

The code compiles on linux and Mac.

This is a school project where I reimplemented some containers from the standard C++, in C++98.
Container functions above C++98 are not implemented.
The containers I reimplemented are map, vector and stack.

Map uses a red-black tree implementation.

A simple main is provided, define STD to compare the output with the standard.
